# Unreachable Code in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates an example of unreachable code in a Julia function.  The `return 0` statement in `my_function` is unreachable because the `if` and `else` blocks always return a value.

## Bug

The bug is the presence of the `return 0` statement, which is never executed.  This can happen due to logical errors in conditional statements.

## Solution

The solution is to remove the unreachable code.  This improves code clarity and efficiency, although in this case, the impact on efficiency is minimal.
